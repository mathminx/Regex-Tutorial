# Regex-Tutorial

## Summary
This tutorial will walk you through the process of deciphering a simple regex in JavaScript by decomposing it into its component parts and explaining the meaning and function of each. Some characters have a special meaning, while others can change the meaning of certain characters, depending on the context. Many characters are also used in their literal sense, that is, in the way that we would normally use them in any garden-variety text. By examining a sample regex used for matching email addresses, I will discuss the components of this particular regex, describe what each character or group of characters signifies, and provide examples of strings that would match or not match components of the regex for clarification purposes.
